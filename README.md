## Project Overview

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The Neighbourhood Map App is a project that has been developed using Vanilla Javascript. By utilizing the open-source Leaflet JavaScript library, a map has been incorporated into the project. Additionally, markers have been added to indicate the location of each site listing based on their respective co-ordinates. To enhance the styling of the site listings, the project has also integrated the Swiper library. Whenever you click on one of the attractions, the map will dynamically show its address and pinpoint the exact location on the map. The app now features the city's weather information, allowing users to easily check the weather forecast for the next two days. Furthermore, the app has incorporated the use of Unsplash's free API to provide photos of the city.
